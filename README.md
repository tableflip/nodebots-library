**The NodeBots Esoteric Hardware Library &amp; Exchange Program**

## The plan

Create an inventory of all the strange and programmable items that we have in nodebots chapter / hackerspaces / tool shed's hardware/tools archive.

Anyone can come borrow things for their own hack days. Participation is free, but it is encouraged that you add something to the library (don't be a leacher) and that you help teach someone what you learn whilst hacking with the borrowed item.

Numerous companies have invested in drones and bots and boards, and for the most part they sit idle, so all of these should be added to the inventory too.

- List of things with owner and current custodian / whereabouts.
- List of members.

As an example, we took the entire collection up to OxfordJS for a hack day there and it was much fun.

**The spirit of nodebots seems to be access to tools, toys, and tutors, so the idea behind the library it to help create an informal network of interested hackers.**
